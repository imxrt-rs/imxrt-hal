//! Secure real-time clock.
//!
//! Basic support only: Supports enabling and setting the clock, but not any of its more
//! advanced features (alarm, calibration, stop on security violation, etc).
//!
//! The Secure Real-Time Clock continues tracking time until it is specifically disabled or loses
//! power, even through a system reboot (and potentially a loss of power to the system, if the
//! SRTC is connected to a battery).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use imxrt_hal as hal;
//! use imxrt_ral as ral;
//!
//! # || -> Option<()> {
//! let mut ccm = unsafe { ral::ccm::CCM::instance() };
//! hal::ccm::clock_gate::snvs_lp().set(&mut ccm, hal::ccm::clock_gate::ON);
//!
//! let hal::snvs::Snvs { low_power: hal::snvs::LowPower {
//!     mut core, srtc, ..
//! }, .. } = hal::snvs::new(unsafe { ral::snvs::SNVS::instance() });
//! let srtc = srtc.enable_and_set(&mut core, 1600000000, 0);
//! let now = srtc.get();
//! # Some(())}();
//! ```
