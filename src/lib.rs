//! A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for i.MX RT MCUs.
//!
//! `imxrt-hal` contains a collection of hardware drivers for various i.MX RT
//! MCUs. A default build of `imxrt-hal` provides drivers that are portable
//! across all i.MX RT chips. When your specific chip is known, `imxrt-hal`
//! provides additional, chip-specific APIs. Most drivers implement their
//! corresponding `embedded-hal` traits, or they can be adapted to use
//! `embedded-hal` traits in user code.
//!
//! # Building
//!
//! `imxrt-hal` requires that you, or something in your dependency graph, enable
//! a chip-specific feature from `imxrt-ral`, the i.MX RT _register access layer
//! (RAL)_.  Without this, the HAL does not build. Since the HAL uses the RAL in
//! its public API, you're expected to depend on both packages.
//!
//! Here's an example of a project that builds the `imxrt-hal` for an i.MX RT
//! 1062 system.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.imxrt-hal] # There's no required feature here...
//! version = # ...
//!
//! [dependencies.imxrt-ral]
//! version = # ...
//! features = ["imxrt1062"] # ...but this feature is required.
//! ```
//!
//! Once you've enabled a RAL feature, the HAL builds without any additional
//! features. All APIs exposed in this build are portable across all supported
//! i.MX RT chips.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! See each module's documentation for examples. Note that documentation
//! examples may assume a specific chip and chip family, so you may need to
//! adapt the example for your hardware.
//!
//! The `imxrt-hal` repository maintains examples that run on various i.MX RT
//! development boards. See the project documentation for more information.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! Use these optional features to control the HAL build.
//!
//! | Feature           | Description                                                      |
//! |-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `"imxrt1010"`     | Enable features for the 1010 chips.                              |
//! | `"imxrt1020"`     | Enable features for the 1020 chips.                              |
//! | `"imxrt1060"`     | Enable features for the 1060 chips.                              |
//! | `"imxrt1064"`     | Enable features for the 1064 chips.                              |
//! | `"imxrt1170"`     | Enable features for the 1170 chips.                              |
//! | `"eh02-unproven"` | Enable implementations for embedded-hal 0.2 `"unproven"` traits. |
//! | `"rand_core"`     | Allows the TRNG to be used with the `rand` package.              |
//!
//! The APIs exposed by the various `"imxrt[...]"` features are chip specific.
//! The HAL does not support building with more than one of these features at a
//! time.
//!
//! When enabling a HAL chip feature, make sure that it pairs properly with your
//! RAL chip selection. You are responsible for making sure that your RAL chip
//! feature is appropriate for the HAL chip feature. For instance, mixing the
//! RAL's `imxrt1062` feature with the HAL's `imxrt1010` feature is not
//! supported.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.imxrt-hal]
//! version = # ...
//! #Bad: doesn't support RAL feature.
//! #features = ["imxrt1010"]
//!
//! #Good: supports RAL feature
//! features = ["imxrt1060"]
//!
//! [dependencies.imxrt-ral]
//! version = # ...
//! features = ["imxrt1062"] # Informs the HAL chip feature
//! ```
//!
//! The `"eh02-unproven"` feature will not build without the corresponding
//! `"unproven"` feature enabled in embedded-hal 0.2.

/// # Overview
///
/// Use [`clock_gate`](crate::ccm::clock_gate) APIs to enable or disable the clock gates for
/// various peripherals. You'll need to enable clock gates before you
/// start using peripherals.
///
/// The remaining modules provide lower-level APIs for the CCM clock
/// tree. These APIs may not be portable across chip families.
///
/// # Visibility
///
/// If you see items in this module, it's because a chip family feature is
/// enabled in the HAL. These symbols may vary depending on the selected
/// feature.

/// Direct memory access.
///
/// Use the `dma` APIs to perform memory operations without processor intervention.
/// The API supports the following transfers:
///
/// - peripheral to memory
/// - memory to peripheral
/// - memory to memory
///
/// Peripheral support depends on the peripheral. See your peripheral's API for details.
/// Methods that use DMA are typically prefixed with `dma`.
///
/// DMA transfers are modeled as futures. The examples below demonstrate a simple way
/// to start a transfer. Since these are futures, you may use these futures in `async` code.
///
/// # DMA channels
///
/// The API provides access to at least 16 DMA channels. If you've enabled an optional chip
/// family feature, this number may change. See [`CHANNEL_COUNT`](crate::dma::CHANNEL_COUNT)
/// for more information.
///
/// # Visibility
///
/// Select items become visible when a chip family feature is enabled.
///
/// # Example
///
/// Use [`channels()`](crate::dma::channels) to access all DMA channels for your processor.
///
/// ```no_run
/// use imxrt_hal as hal;
/// use imxrt_ral as ral;

/// let mut channel = channels[13].take()?;
