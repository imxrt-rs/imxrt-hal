//! Direct Memory Access (DMA)
//!
//! We support
//!
//! - DMA from memory to a peripheral. Transfers may be uni- or bi-directional.
//!   See the [`Peripheral`](struct.Peripheral.html) for details.
//! - DMA memory copy, or memory-to-memory transfers. See [`Memcpy`](struct.Memcpy.html)
//!  for details.
//!
//! DMA types support either [`Linear`](struct.Linear.html) or [`Circular`](struct.Circular.html)
//! memory buffers. Either may be used as a DMA transfer source or destination. Both are backed
//! by statically-allocated [`Buffer`s](struct.Buffer.html). A user will create a memory buffer,
//! then pass ownership to a DMA type that defines a transfer. When the transfer completes, the
//! DMA type will release ownership back to the user.
//!
//! # Terms
//!
//! - *Source* is a location in memory that provides data. A source may be a buffer
//!    of data, or a peripheral register.
//! - *Destination* is a location in memory that will receive data.
//!   A destination may be a buffer of data, or a peripheral register.
//! - *Transfer* is an overloaded term, meaning either a DMA transfer, or the movement
//!   of data out of software, through a peripheral, to an external device.
//! - *DMA Transfer* is an operation achieved by the DMA controller to move data from a
//!   source to a destination.
//! - *Receive* means that we're moving data into software, through a peripheral, from an
//!   external device.
//!
//! # Example: Full-Duplex SPI Peripheral
//!
//! In this example, we prepare a SPI peripheral (SPI4) with two DMA
//! channels. One channel will send data; the other will receive data.
//! The example assumes that the user has registered a DMA interrupt
//! handler, since we're enabling an interrupt when the receive completes.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use imxrt_hal::dma::{Circular, Buffer, Linear, Peripheral, bidirectional_u16};

//! #[repr(align(512))]

//! # Notes on Data Cache
//!
//! If your i.MX RT system is using a data cache (DCache), you're responsible for issuing memory barriers,

//! - Channel chaining
