//! Logging extensions for i.MX RT processors.
//!
//! `imxrt-log` supports two logging frontends:
//!
//! - [`defmt`][defmt-docs] for efficient logging.
//! - [`log`][log-docs] for text-based logging.
//!
//! See the [`defmt`] and [`log`] modules for more information.
//!
//! `imxrt-log` builds upon the `imxrt-hal` hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
//! and provides two peripheral backends:
//!
//! - LPUART with DMA
//! - USB serial (CDC) device
//!
//! Mix and match these frontends and backends to integrate logging into your
//! i.MX RT processor. To understand the differences of each frontend, see
//! the package documentation. Read on to learn about building this package,
//! and to understand the differences in each backend.
//!
//! # Building
//!
//! Given its dependency on [`imxrt-hal`][hal-docs], this package has the same build
//! requirements as `imxrt-hal`. To learn how to build this package, consult the
//! HAL documentation. Essentially, if you can build the HAL, you can build this
//! package.
//!
//! This package uses [`critical-section`](https://crates.io/crates/critical-section)
//! to ensure safe concurrent access to the log producer. In order for this
//! to build, you must select a correct critical section implementation for your
//! system. See the `critical-section` documentation for more information.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Logging frontends place log frames in a circular buffer. Compile- and run-time
//! filters prevent log message formatting and copies. For more frontend
//! design details, see the documentation of each frontend module.
//!
//! Backends read from this circular buffer and asynchronously transfer data out
//! of memory. Backends may buffer data as part of their implementation.
//!
//! The circular buffer is the limiting resource. Once you initialize a logger
//! with a frontend-backend combination, you cannot initialize any other loggers.
//!
//! # Backend usage
//!
//! The LPUART and USB backends provide a consistent interface to drive logging.
//! After initializing a front and backend pair, you receive a [`Poller`] object.
//! In order to move log messages, you must occasionally call `poll()` on the poller
//! object. Each `poll()` call either does nothing, or drives the asynchronous
//! transfer of log messages from your peripheral.
//!
//! The API allows you to enable or disable interrupts that fire when a transfer
//! completes. Depending on the backend, the interrupt may periodically trigger.
//! If the interrupt periodically triggers, you can use the interrupt to occasionally
//! call `poll()`.
//!
//! The backends have some behavioral and performance differences. They're also
//! initialized differently. The next section describes these differences.
//!
//! ## LPUART with DMA
//!
//! The LPUART with DMA implementation transports log messages over LPUART using
//! DMA transfers. In summary,
//!
//! - Initialize your LPUART before initializing the logger.
//! - If you enable interrupts, define your interrupt handlers.
//! - Bring your own timer to call `poll()`.
//! - It uses less memory than USB.
//!
//! _Initialization_. The logging initialiation routine requires an LPUART
//! object from `imxrt-hal`. Configure your `Lpuart` object with baud rates,
//! parity bits, etc. before supplying it to the logging initialization routine.
//!
//! The initialization routine also requires a DMA channel. Any DMA channel will
//! do. The implementation fully configures the DMA channel, so there is no need for
//! you to configure the channel.
//!
//! _Interrupts_. If you enable interrupts (see [`Interrupts`]), the DMA channel
//! asserts its interrupt when each transfer completes. You must call `poll()`
//! to clear the interrupt. The implementation does not touch LPUART interrupts.
//!
//! _Timers_. The interrupts enabled by the LPUART backend cannot periodically
//! trigger. Therefore, you are responsible for periodically calling `poll()`.
//! Consider using a PIT or GPT timer from `imxrt-hal` to help with this, or
//! consider calling `poll()` in a software loop.
//!
//! _Buffer management_. The implementation performs DMA transfers directly out
//! of the log message buffer. This means that there is no intermediate buffer
//! for log messages. The implementation frees the log messages from the circular
//! buffer once the transfer completes.
//!
//! ## USBD
//!
//! The USB device implementation transports log messages over USB by presenting
//! a serial (USB CDC) class to a USB host. In summary,
//!
//! - Simply provide USB register blocks to the logger initialization routine.
//! - If you enable interrupts, define your interrupt handles.
//! - You might not need your own timer.
//! - It uses more memory than LPUART.
//!
//! _Initialization_. The logging initialization routine handles all peripheral
//! configuration. You simply provide the USB register block instances; `imxrt-hal`
//! can help with this.
//!
//! By default, the initialization routine configures a high-speed USB device with
//! a 512 byte bulk endpoint max packet size. You can change these settings with
//! build-time environment variables, discussed later.
//!
//! _Interrupts_. If you enable interrupts (see [`Interrupts`]), the USB device
//! controller asserts its interrupt when each transfer completes. It also enables
//! a USB-managed timer to periodically trigger the interrupt. You must call `poll()`
//! to clear these interrupt conditions.
//!
//! _Timers_. If you enable interrupts, the associated USB interrupt periodically
//! fires. You can use this to periodically call `poll()` without using any other
//! timer or software loop.
//!
//! The timer has a default interval. You can configure this interval through each
//! logger initialization routine.
//!
//! If you do not enable interrupts, you're responsible for periodically calling
//! `poll()`. See the LPUART _timers_ discussion for recommendations.
//!
//! _Buffer management_. The implementation copies data out of the circular buffer
//! and places it in an intermediate transfer buffer. Once this copy completes, the
//! implementation frees the log frames from the circular buffer, and starts the
//! USB transfer from this intermediate buffer. The requirement for the intermediate
//! buffer is a USB driver implementation detail that increases this backend's memory
//! requirements.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! It's easiest to use the USB backend because it has a built-in timer, and the
//! implementation handles all peripheral initialization. The example below shows
//! an interrupt-driven USB logger. It uses `imxrt-hal` APIs to prepare the logger.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use imxrt_log::defmt; // <-- Change 'defmt' to 'log' to change the frontend.
//! use imxrt_hal as hal;
//! use imxrt_ral as ral;
//!
//! use ral::interrupt;
//! #[cortex_m_rt::interrupt]
//! fn USB_OTG1() {
//!     static mut POLLER: Option<imxrt_log::Poller> = None;
//!     if let Some(poller) = POLLER.as_mut() {
//!         poller.poll();
//!     } else {
//!         let poller = initialize_logger().unwrap();
//!         *POLLER = Some(poller);
//!         // Since we enabled interrupts, this interrupt
//!         // handler will be called for USB traffic and timer
//!         // events. These are handled by poll().
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! /// Initialize a USB logger.
//! ///
//! /// Returns `None` if any USB peripheral instance is taken,
//! /// or if initialization fails.
//! fn initialize_logger() -> Option<imxrt_log::Poller> {
//!     let usb_instances = hal::usbd::Instances {
//!         usb: unsafe { ral::usb::USB1::instance() },
//!         usbnc: unsafe { ral::usbnc::USBNC1::instance() },
//!         usbphy: unsafe { ral::usbphy::USBPHY1::instance() },
//!     };
//!     // Initialize the logger, and ensure that it triggers interrupts.
//!     let poller = defmt::usbd(usb_instances, imxrt_log::Interrupts::Enabled).ok()?;
//!     Some(poller)
//! }
//!
//! // Elsewhere in your code, configure USB clocks. Then, pend the USB_OTG1()
//! // interrupt so that it fires and initializes the logger.
//! # || -> Option<()> {
//! let mut ccm = unsafe { ral::ccm::CCM::instance() };
//! let mut ccm_analog = unsafe { ral::ccm_analog::CCM_ANALOG::instance() };
//! hal::ccm::analog::pll3::restart(&mut ccm_analog);
//! hal::ccm::clock_gate::usb().set(&mut ccm, hal::ccm::clock_gate::ON);
//!
//! cortex_m::peripheral::NVIC::pend(interrupt::USB_OTG1);
//! // Safety: interrupt handler is self contained and safe to unmask.
//! unsafe { cortex_m::peripheral::NVIC::unmask(interrupt::USB_OTG1) };
//! # Some(()) }().unwrap();
//!
//! // After the USB device enumerates and configures, you're ready for
//! // logging.
//! ::defmt::info!("Hello world!");
//! ```
//!
//! For an advanced example that uses RTIC, see the `rtic_logging` example
//! maintained in the `imxrt-hal` repository. This example lets you easily explore
//! all frontend-backend combinations, and it works on various i.MX RT development
//! boards.
//!
//! # Package configurations
//!
//! You can configure this package at compile time.
//!
//! - Binary configurations use feature flags.
//! - Variable configurations use environment variables set during compilation.
//!
//! The table below describes the package feature flags. Default features make it
//! easy for you to use all package features. To reduce dependencies, disable this
//! package's default features, then selectively enable frontends and backends.
//!
//! | Feature flag | Description                         | Enabled by default? |
//! | ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
//! | `defmt`      | Enable the `defmt` logging frontend |        Yes          |
//! | `log`        | Enable the `log` logging frontend   |        Yes          |
//! | `lpuart`     | Enable the LPUART backend           |        Yes          |
//! | `usbd`       | Enable the USB device backend       |        Yes          |
//!
//! This package isn't particularly interesting without a frontend-backend combination,
//! so this configuration is not supported. Any features not listed above are considered
//! an implementation detail and may change without notice.
//!
//! Environment variables provide additional configuration hooks. The table below
//! describes the supported configuration variables and their effects on the build.
//!
//! | Environment variable           | Description                                               | Default value | Accepted values           |
//! | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
//! | `IMXRT_LOG_USB_BULK_MPS`       | Bulk endpoint max packet size, in bytes.                  |     512       | One of 8, 16, 32, 64, 512 |
//! | `IMXRT_LOG_USB_SPEED`          | Specify a high (USB2) or full (USB 1.1) speed USB device. |    HIGH       | Either `HIGH` or `FULL`   |
//! | `IMXRT_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE`        | Specify the log message buffer size, in bytes.            |    1024       | An integer power of two   |
//!
//! Note:
//!
//! - `IMXRT_LOG_USB_*` are always permitted. If `usbd` is disabled, then `IMXRT_LOG_USB_*`
//!    configurations do nothing.
//! - If `IMXRT_LOG_USB_SPEED=FULL`, then `IMXRT_LOG_USB_BULK_MPS` cannot be 512. On the other hand,
//!   if `IMXRT_LOG_USB_SPEED=HIGH`, then `IMXRT_LOG_USB_BULK_MPS` must be 512.
//! - Both `IMXRT_LOG_USB_BULK_MPS` and `IMXRT_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE` affect internally-managed buffer
//!   sizes. If space is tight, reduces these numbers to reclaim memory.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! Although it uses `critical-section`, this logging package may not be designed for immediate
//! use in a multi-core system, like the i.MX RT 1160 and 1170 MCUs. Notably, there's no critical
//! section implementation for these processors that would ensure safe, shared access to the log
//! producer across the cores. Furthermore, its not yet clear how to build embedded Rust applications
//! for these systems.
//!
//! Despite these limitations, it may be possible to use this package on multi-core MCUs, but you need
//! to treat them as two single-core MCUs. Specifically, you would need to build two binaries -- one for
//! each core, each having separate memory regions for data -- and each core would need to use its own,
//! distinct peripheral for transport. Then, select a single-core `critical-section` implementation,
//! like the one provided by `cortex-m`.
