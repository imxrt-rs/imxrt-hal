//! Preset clock tree configurations and frequencies.
//!
//! Use `configure` to simply configure the clock tree for a given
//! run mode. After `configure`, the system clocks run at the frequencies
//! described by each `*_frequency` function. The frequencies for a given
//! run mode are less than or equal to the maximum allowed for the given
//! run mode. Consult your MCU's reference manual for more information.
//!
//! Use `*_frequency` functions to understand the target system clock frequencies.
//! Note that these functions are `const`, and should be usable in constant
//! contexts.
